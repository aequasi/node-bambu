# Todo

- Convert to SQLite/TypeORM
- Move to support multiple printers
  - Printers should be able to have:
    - host
    - port
    - token
    - serial
    - streamUrl
    - image
    - type (maybe able to get this programmatically?)
  - Update commands to take a printer name
    - Autocomplete it!
    - Only do this if there are more than one printer
